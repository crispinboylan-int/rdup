rdup is a small program, which depends on a number of a other programs
and tools to make it all work. The dependencies are listed here:

Mandatory:

* libglib (core C gtk library)
* libpcre (Perl regular expressions)
* libnettle  (Nettle - small crypto library)
* libarchive (Create tar/cpio/etc archive - used in rdup-tr)

If libarchive is not found rdup-tr is not built.

Cygwin dependencies:
* Build:
  * autoconf,automake,gcc-core,make
  * libarchive-devel,libglib2.0-devel,libnettle-devel,libpcre-devel
* Test: dejagnu,mcrypt
* Run: libarchive20,libglib2.0_0,libnettle8,libpcre2

To build from git:

    autoconf && ./configure && make && make install

from tar.bz2:

    ./configure && make && make install

To run the testsuite:

    make check

DejaGNU is used for the testsuite.

Some small shell scripts are included in the sh/ directory
they depend on bash, GNU date and GNU cp.
